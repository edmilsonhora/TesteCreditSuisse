Question 2: A new category was created called PEP (politically exposed person). Also, a new bool property
IsPoliticallyExposed was created in the ITrade interface. A trade shall be categorized as PEP if
IsPoliticallyExposed is true. Describe in at most 1 paragraph what you must do in your design to account for this
new category.

A:  I create a new Class called PoliticallyExposedPerson inheriting from the abstract Categorizer class and implement the Execute method
checking if the 'IsPoliticallyExposed' field is equal to True if yes I set the Category property with the value 'PEP'
then I add this new class to the call hierarchy.
